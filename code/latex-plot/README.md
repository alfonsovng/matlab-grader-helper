# Latex Plot

Function to show some lines of text or formulas expressed in latex as an image. It is useful to show some Latex text, for instance a problem to solve, inside Matlab Grader. I did it because it is not possible to personalize the statement of a problem. So we are showing a personalized statement as an image when the student runs the script.

Check the [test](./test/) and the [examples](../../examples/) 3 and 4 for more details.
