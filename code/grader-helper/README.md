# Matlab Grader Helper

Helper code for matlab grader. Main funtionalies are:

* Compare figures generated with plot and fplot. The comparison function checks the color, the line width and the type of line, the interval of definition, and the function (fplot) or the list of points (plot).
* Compare functions defined in a different way, but they are algebraically equivalent. For instance, x+2 is the same as x+1+1.
* Simplify the comparison of variables.

Check the [test](./test/) and all the [examples](../../examples/) for more details.

Take a look the the 4th example to know more about the report mode.
