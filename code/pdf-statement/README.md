# PDF Statement

Function to generate personalized statements of problems in PDF.

*Disclaimer!* The entire project, but especially this function, is code that may have errors or not be finished. Test the PDF generation before printing a 500 pdf statements to avoid realize, later, that you killed a bunch of trees for nothing because some latex function is not right.

Check the [test](./test/) and the 4th of the [examples](../../examples/).
